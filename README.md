### **PackAdoption - Animal Rescue and Adoption Management System**
---

**PackAdoption** is a Java-based application designed to manage the adoption process for rescued animals. Built with **Java OOP** principles and a **Swing-based GUI**, it provides a comprehensive system for tracking animals, rescue history, and managing the adoption queue. The system ensures a smooth and organized workflow for animal adoption centers.

### **Key Features:**

- **Animal Management:** Allows users to manage a list of rescued animals with detailed information (e.g., breed, age, size).
- **Adoption Queue:** Implements a priority-based adoption queue to ensure fair and efficient management.
- **Rescue History Tracking:** Keeps detailed records of when animals were rescued, their health status, and adoption status.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides an intuitive GUI for managing animal records, viewing available animals, and handling adoptions.

### **Technologies Used:**

- **Java OOP:** Object-Oriented Programming to structure the application effectively.
- **Java Swing:** Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **File I/O:** Manages data persistence by reading and writing animal and rescue information from/to files.

### **How to Run:**

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.ncsu.edu/dswelam/vet-adoption-manager.git`
   
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

3. Build and run the `Main` class to launch the application.

### **Future Improvements:**

- Add more filtering options for animal categories (e.g., species, health status).
- Implement real-time synchronization with online animal adoption platforms.
- Add more sophisticated queue management features (e.g., priority based on medical needs).
- Improve the GUI by incorporating modern design principles.
